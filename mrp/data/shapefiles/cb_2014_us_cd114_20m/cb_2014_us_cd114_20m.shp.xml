         <abstract>The 2014 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.

Congressional Districts are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  After the apportionment of congressional seats among the States based on census population counts, each State is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives.  Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a State as practicable.  The 114th Congress is seated from January 2015 to 2017. The cartographic boundary files for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas.  The boundaries of all other congressional districts are provided to the Census Bureau through the Redistricting Data Program (RDP).</abstract>
         <purpose>These files were specifically created to support small-scale thematic mapping.  To improve the appearance of shapes at small scales, areas are represented with fewer vertices than detailed TIGER/Line Shapefiles.  Cartographic boundary files take up less disk space than their ungeneralized counterparts.  Cartographic boundary files take less time to render on screen than TIGER/Line Shapefiles.  You can join this file with table data downloaded from American FactFinder by using the AFFGEOID field in the cartographic boundary file.  If detailed boundaries are required, please use the TIGER/Line Shapefiles instead of the generalized cartographic boundary files.</purpose>

         <attraccr>Accurate against American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Publication INCITS 446-2008 (Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)) at the 100% level for the codes and base names present in the file.  The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency of the source database.  Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  All polygons were tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as INCITS (formerly FIPS) codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.  Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.

For the cartographic boundary files, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the file's data table.  For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature.  Cartographic Boundary File multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification.  Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a file, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.</logic>
      <complete>The cartographic boundary files are generalized representations of extracts taken from the MAF/TIGER Database. Generalized boundary files are clipped to a simplified version of the U.S. outline. As a result, some off-shore areas may be excluded from the generalized files. Some small holes or discontiguous parts of areas are not included in generalized files.</complete>
